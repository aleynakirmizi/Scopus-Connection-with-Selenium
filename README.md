# Scopus-Connection-with-Selenium
Scraping title,date and abstract from Scopus using Python Selenium 

I've logged in many times to Scopus with my instution user name. This program will work if you've logged in Scopus one time. 
You should give permission to Scopus to remember your informations before you try scraping data. 


You need to give your chromedriver.exe path first. After you give your user name and password informations you'll get your informations.

This code was written by me to use on my thesis.
