# Scopus-Connection-with-Selenium
Extracting title, date, and abstract data from Scopus using Python and Selenium.

I have used my institution's username to log in to Scopus multiple times. This program requires a one-time login to Scopus. Please ensure that you have granted permission to Scopus to remember your information before attempting to scrape data.

Before running the program, please provide the path to your chromedriver.exe file. Once you have entered your username and password information, you will receive your desired data.

The program utilizes the "DB Browser for SQLite" database to store the scraped data.

I developed this code for use in my thesis project.
